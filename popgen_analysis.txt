Population genetics Analysis Log File
This is started after receving first round of reviews from Molecular Ecology
22 February 2016

The reviewers want a general re-structuring of the paper, plus I need to check/fix/add the following things:
-Migration analysis with MIGRATE
-Calculate isolation by distance on contigs or single SNP per contig
-use a more statistical approach to IBD
-only do IBD on neutral loci
-Look for the distribution of IBD across loci
-Use neutral loci to generate Fst CIs
-Test the association between Pst and Fst on a locus-by-locus basis or use morphological data in Bayenv
-Apply common subspace approach to complete set of population P-matrices
-use GIS to calculate distances instead of Google Maps
-Standardize the traits for size (possibly--or at least justify why not)
-Summary statistics output from stacks needs to be modified
-Report sequencing coverage
-How many of the 66 SNPs were unlinked?
-Better description of evaluating K from structure
-Why are there so many extreme Pst values (1)
X-Did LD pruning work as expected? Are SNPs from the same RAD locus removed?
-Instead of mean temperature, use a temperature anomaly?

I realized that the reason I was getting NAN values from Bayenv2 was because my standardized.env file was messed up--full of NANs. So I found the real version and am re-running bayenv2.

Huh. for some reason it's getting overwritten or something because after running several bayenv2 runs it's back to having nans...

And it doesn't look like it's standardized properly. I need to return to this when I can pay more attention to it.

I'm choosing a 5% cutoff for the XtX and Bayes Factors from Bayenv, same as before.
That yields 88 of each.
Something didn't work right with the environmental associations. 1633 of them have NAs and the rest, except one, all have the same BF value. Weird.

Re-starting migrate with Bayesian inference with number of recorded steps in chain to 1000.

On my home computer I found a more complete popgen analysis.


#####Saturday, 19 March 2016
My bayenv matrix was formatted incorrectly. Once I fixed it I was able to run the environmental correlations no problem.

#####Friday, 11 March 2016
Ran populations on the pruned SNPs to generate Fsts, summary stats, etc.
	populations -b 1 -P ./stacks -M ./stacks/marine_map.txt -s -W ./stacks/populations/subset.whitelist.txt -t 2 --fstats --plink --vcf

I had to re-start structure because of a power outage.

#***IBD***#
Reading up on IBD: it can reflect population structure, and pop structure can reflect it. 
In Meirmans 2012: One way to take the hierarchical structure into account is to use a stratified Mantel test in which the permutation scheme is changed to permute the locations of populations within the clusters (Oksanen et al. 2009)...it is advised to use clustering approaches that take the geographical position of the samples into account (e.g. Fran√ßois et al. 2006)...A partial Mantel test can also be of help here, testing the association between the matrix of genetic distances and a model matrix of cluster membership with the matrix of geographical distances as a covariate (Drummond & Hamilton 2007)

#***MIGRATE***#
I also downloaded migrate for Windows and am trying to run it but something's not working correctly.
I'm running the hapmap format parameter...maybe theres a designation about filenames or something that I need to change. I'm trying replacing the locus ID with a locus count (an integer instead of a string)

There are a number of loci that appear not to be polymorphic. I've added some code to add a 0 count if necessary. That didn't fix it (but it's certainly a good thing to do.) I found a post on the google forum that says, "the migrate manual contains an error and you will need to enter the maximal number of individual for each population in the population line." <-I'm pretty sure he means max number of alleles, since in the example the number preceding the pop name is the max number found in the 'total' column. That fixed it!!! Now it's running


#####Wednesday, 9 March 2016
I wrote plink_to_migrate to convert my subset.ped and subset.map files into a format compatible with migrate.
I need to re-code the FamID part of the ped file probably to refer to the populations. I did that in R (popgen_analysis.R)

#***Bayenv2***#
Working on Bayenv2:
Once the subset files have been fixed up in R, in bayenv2/:
plink --file bayenv.plink --freq --within plink.clust.txt --noweb --allow-no-sex --out subset.bayenv.plink
saved new snpsfile as pruned.SNPSFILE in bayenv2/
Now I'm running bayenv2 on pruned.SNPSFILE, 10 iterations, to generate a SNPS matrix.
All of the matrices look the same. 
plink --file ../stacks/populations/batch_1.plink --freq --within all.6348.clust.txt --allow-no-sex --noweb --out all.bayenv.plink
Then turned it into all.SNPSFILE in R.
~/Programs/bayenv_2/bayenv2 -i all.SNPSFILE -m matrix.1.out -n 1 -p 12 -k 1000000 -t -X -r 13425
^^that doesn't work. I need to use individual snps from the pruned snps. It is better to use unlinked SNPs, so I should use the pruned dataset.

So I need to split the file...did that in R.
But now I'm getting a segmentation fault! Why??



#***FastStructure***#
To run faststructure, I needed to edit the plink --recode-structure output by removing the first two lines, which I did in jEdit. 
but faststructure isn't finding the files..it has to be /home/sarah/sf_ubuntushare/popgen/... not ~/sf_ubuntushare/popgen/..
Now it's running. distruct says, 
	Model complexity that maximizes marginal likelihood = 2
	Model components used to explain structure in data = 5
So now I'm running it with K=2 to K=5 with logistic prior instead of --full. (This part probably isn't necessary).

#***Structure***#
Started running Structure with K=1 through K=12, 10 repetitions of each, with admixture model.

#***PRUNING***#
The pruning seems to work, it retains 3802 loci. Now for HWE. Doing that in R, since I've already got a function to do it (I just have to modify it for a ped file).
Only 838 pass my hwe pruning in R...1581 pass at 0.001 level, which is plink's default. Plink retains 1753.
plink --file pruned --hwe 0.001 --noweb --allow-no-sex --recodeA --recode --out subset
Plink is easier because I don't have to reformat the files myself, so I'll go with that.

#***ADEGENET***#
OK, I've done that. Now I need to run adegenet. Done!
#***PCAdapt***#
I apparently didn't save the pcadapt commands. No, I did, it was just in PCAdapt folder in ~/Programs/
Now I'm running PCAdapt from ~/sf_ubuntushare/popgen/ directory with K = 1 through K = 12.
K=4 was the best. So I'm running it 10 times with K=4. They're not super consistent but they're probably good enough. Good enough for the one to be a representative run.
#***Bayenv***#
For Bayenv2, I ran the R code to reformat plink. After first bit I ran plink --file subset --freq --within --plink.clust.txt --noweb --allow-no-sex --out subset.bayenv.plink. I'm having some problems with this.


#####Thursday, 3 March 2016
First thing I need to do is to re-prune to ensure that SNPs are not actually on the same locus. So, I'll take a PLINK file (pruned for hwe in PLINK) and then write a program that will read the file and for each locus randomly choose one of the SNPs to be the SNP for that locus. I will also evaluate how far RAD loci are from each other and only keep one SNP every ~2kb (so if a RAD locus is 1kb away from another locus in either direction I'll randomly choose one of those SNPs to keep, I guess). 

#####28 February 2016
I've fixed the map as per a reviewer's request. 
Now for the hard part. First, I need to check to see if my pruned SNPs set does not include multiple SNPs per RAD locus and see how many are on the scaffold, and how far apart they are. (e.g. make sure the pruning actually worked).

So...the 1833 SNPs are not all in individual RAD loci. They represent 1562 RAD loci. And 1248 scaffolds.

So I think I need to consider re-doing that by taking one SNP from each RAD locus. Then I can do the HWE pruning and some LD pruning, maybe. 

#####22 February 2016
Thoughts on how to proceed:
-should I just take one SNP from the RAD locus rather than do the pruning-for-LD-approach? 
-I need to figure out which files I used for what and re-acquaint myself with these data.
-Calculate average distance between RAD loci on the same scaffold??
