# Example Data

This section contains a SNPs input file for dadi, along with the results from the three 
rounds of optimizations and the final plots. These were generated using the scripts in the
Two_Populations section. If you specify the correct path to the SNPs file here, those scripts 
will run with these data. 

**The standard plotting routine will fail for these data!**

I mentioned a potential issue that crashes the dadi plotting routine, and it does affect this
data set. The fix is very simple, and the explanation and instructions are found in the 
*Plotting_Error_Fix* section of the repository.
